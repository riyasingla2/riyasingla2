# hey, i’m riya  

i’m passionate about algorithms, sustainable technology, artificial intelligence, and human-centered topics like AI ethics & explainability. beyond just learning, i love designing solutions to non-obvious problems and building systems that push boundaries and reimagine how we experience the world.  

outside of tech, i enjoy exploring new places, writing my thoughts on [substack](https://riiturtle.substack.com) and creating art ([portfolio](https://www.instagram.com/r1yaart/))  

i’m always excited to connect with people who share similar interests.
