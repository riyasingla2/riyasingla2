# hey, i’m riya  

i’m passionate about algorithms, sustainable technology, artificial intelligence, and human-centered topics like AI ethics & explainability. Beyond just learning, I love designing solutions to non-obvious problems and building systems that push boundaries and reimagine how we experience the world.  

outside of tech, i enjoy exploring new places, writing my thoughts on [Substack](#) and creating art ([Portfolio](#))  

i’m always excited to connect with people who share similar interests.
